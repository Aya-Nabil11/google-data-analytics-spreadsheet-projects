# Scope of Work and Structured Thinking

## 📌 Overview
This task focuses on applying structured thinking in data analysis by creating a **Scope of Work (SOW)** document for a mock data analysis project. The objective is to practice defining project requirements, boundaries, and expectations clearly before beginning analysis, which helps reduce errors and improve project outcomes.

This activity is part of the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate** on Coursera.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

### Structured Thinking
A systematic approach to problem-solving that involves clearly defining the problem, organizing available information, identifying gaps, and planning analysis steps before starting work.

### Scope of Work (SOW)
A formal document that outlines what work will be done in a project, including deliverables, timelines, milestones, and reporting expectations. It ensures alignment between analysts, stakeholders, and sponsors.

## 🧩 Components of the Scope of Work

### Deliverables
Clearly defined outputs expected from the project, such as cleaned datasets, analysis reports, or visualizations. Deliverables are specific, measurable, and tied to business goals.

### Milestones
Key checkpoints that indicate progress throughout the project. Milestones help track whether the project is on schedule and whether major steps have been completed.

### Timeline
A structured schedule that maps tasks and milestones over time. The timeline sets expectations for when each part of the project will be completed.

### Reports
Planned updates shared with stakeholders to communicate progress, findings, and completion of milestones. Reports help maintain transparency and alignment.

## 🔍 In Scope vs Out of Scope
The SOW clearly defines what tasks and data are included in the project and what is excluded. Establishing boundaries prevents confusion, scope creep, and misaligned expectations.

---

## 💡 Why This Matters for Data Analysts
Creating a well-defined SOW helps data analysts:
- Clarify business goals and analytical responsibilities
- Avoid missing variables or requirements
- Reduce wasted time and rework
- Communicate effectively with stakeholders
- Deliver accurate and meaningful insights
